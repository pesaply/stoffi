      text2: "If you send an artist $10 they get the same as if you bought 10 albums on iTunes or listened to their music 18,000 times on Spotify (assuming the $0.0056 stream royalty from 2011). This means you will have to listen to the same artists non-stop a whole month assuming the song is 2:30 long. It's just easier to send them $10."
